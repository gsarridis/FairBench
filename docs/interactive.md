# Interactive Visualization

Interactive visualization explores
complex objects generated with  `FairBench`, such as
forks of forks of measure values (these can compare
the same reports across multiple algorithms).

# Start

To start interactive visualization, call 
`fairbench.interactive(obj)` on an object
`obj` that is a dictionary or fork.

From a console, this will start a bokeh server
that hosts a dynamic web page and will open this
as a tab in your local browser (hard-terminate
the process to stop the server). From a 
Jupyter environment, a bokeh application will
run on the next output cell instead.

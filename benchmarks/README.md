# Fairness Benchmarks

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

We provide notebooks that run fairness benchmarks. 
Competing methods and datasets are retrieved from
the `fairbench.bench` module and require dedicated domain libraries to
run. Install all required dependencies with 
`pip install fairbench[interactive,graph,vision,text]`. Leave out
dependencies in which you are not interested.

Methods are compared pairwise through FairBench, and interfaces are
provided to also compare your own methods. Contributions for out-of-the-box
experimentation are welcome.

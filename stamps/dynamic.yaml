  description:
    "Checks whether the fraction of positive predictions for each protected group 
    is at worst four fifths that of {COMPARISON} (i.e., the p-rule is 0.8 or greater
    for any pairwise group comparison)."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate impact may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration."
  caveats_accept:
    - "Consider input from affected stakeholders to determine whether 
      the 4/5 threshold is appropriate."
    - "Satisfying the 4/5 rule is not a legally accepted indication of disparate impact mitigation."

  description:
    "Computes the worst performance among protected groups; this is the minimum
    benefit the system brings to any group."
  caveats:
    - "The worst accuracy is a lower bound but not an estimation of overall accuracy.
      There may be different distributions of benefits that could be protected."

    The worst ratio is reported, so that value of 0 indicates 
    disparate impact, and value of 1 disparate impact mitigation."

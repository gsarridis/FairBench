  description:
    "Checks whether the fraction of positive predictions for each protected group 
    is at worst four fifths that of {COMPARISON} (i.e., the p-rule is 0.8 or greater
    for any pairwise group comparison)."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate impact may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration, and may obscure other important fairness concerns or create new disparities."
  caveats_accept:
    - "Consider input from affected stakeholders to determine whether 
      the 4/5 threshold is appropriate."
    - "Satisfying the 4/5 rule is not a legally accepted indication of disparate impact mitigation. 
       Different groups may have different positive value distributions."
    - "Ensure continuous monitoring and re-evaluation as group dynamics and external factors evolve."

four_fifths_rule:
  title: "4/5 rule"
  alias: ["minratio.pr", "prule"]
  minimum: 0.8
  description:
    "Checks whether the fraction of positive predictions for each protected group 
    is at worst four fifths that of any other group (i.e., the p-rule is 0.8 or greater
    for any pairwise group comparison)."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate impact may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration."
    - "Consider input from affected stakeholders to determine whether 
      the 4/5 rule is an appropriate fairness criterion."
    - "The 4/5 rule is often not a legally accepted indication of disparate impact."

accuracy:
  title: "worst accuracy"
  alias: ["min.accuracy", "accuracy"]
  description:
    "Computes the worst performance among protected groups; this is the minimum
    benefit the system brings to any group."
  caveats:
    - "The worst accuracy is a lower bound but not an estimation of overall accuracy.
      There may be different distributions of benefits that could be protected."

prule:
  title: "p-rule"
  alias: ["minratio.pr", "prule"]
  description:
    "Compares the fraction of positive predictions between groups.
    The worst ratio is reported, so that value of 0 indicates 
    disparate impact, and value of 1 disparate impact mitigation."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate impact may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration."

dfpr:
  title: "dfpr"
  alias: ["maxdiff.tnr", "dfpr"]
  description:
    "Compares the false positive rates between groups. The maximum difference is reported, so that value of 1 indicates
    disparate mistreatment, and value of 0 disparate mistreatment mitigation."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate mistreatment may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration."
    - "Consider input from affected stakeholders to determine whether dfpr is an appropriate fairness measure."

dfnr:
  title: "dfnr"
  alias: ["maxdiff.tpr", "dfnr"]
  description:
    "The maximum difference is reported, so that value of 1 indicates
    disparate mistreatment, and value of 0 disparate mistreatment mitigation."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate mistreatment may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration."
    - "Consider input from affected stakeholders to determine whether dfnr is an appropriate fairness measure."

abroca:
  title: "abroca"
  alias: ["maxbarea.auc"]
  description:
    "The maximum area between ROC curves.
    This is a type of disparate mistreatment for recommendation systems."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate mistreatment may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration."
    - "Consider input from affected stakeholders to determine whether abroca is an appropriate fairness measure."

maxbdcg:
  title: "NDCG of average precision"
  alias: ["maxbdcg.avgrepr"]
  description:
    "The maximum of NDCG-weighted differences between curves, counting the number of elements
    represented at different top-k predictions. This is a type of disparate impact for recommendation systems."
  caveats:
    - "Disparate impact may not always be an appropriate fairness consideration."
